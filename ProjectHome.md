ScaleDB Interfaces

Benefits of our open API
For Application or DBMS Developers:

  * Enable your application to access ScaleDB's shared-disk cluster storage engine directly, without the need for MySQL.
  * Enable your DBMS to operate in a shared-disk cluster.

For Storage Engine Developers:

  * By using a common storage engine API, we can work together to ensure that other open source DBMS interoperate with all of our engines.

For Database Developers:

  * Support this API and you will gain access the ScaleDB storage engine and all other storage engines that use this API
